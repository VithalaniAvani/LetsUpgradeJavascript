Answer2 : vdifference between var let const.
* var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped.
* var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.
* They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while var variables are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized.
*While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.

Answer 3: Data types in JS
JavaScript has dynamic types. The same variable can be used to hold different data types
Example - 
var x ; //undefined
x = 25; //int
x = "Apple" //string
x = false //boolean
var vehicles = ["car", "Bus", "Cycle"]; //Array
var person = {firstName:"Ana", lastName:"peterson", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"}; //Object
